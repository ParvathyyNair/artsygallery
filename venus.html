        <h1>Venus</h1>
        <p>Venus is the second planet from the Sun and Earth's closest planetary neighbor. It is the hottest planet in our solar system and is often called Earth's twin. Here are some facts about Venus: 
            <br>
            Size and structure: Venus is similar in size and structure to Earth. It has a diameter of 7,520 miles (12,100 km). 
            <br>
            Atmosphere: Venus has a thick atmosphere that traps heat, making it very hot. The atmosphere is made up of 96% carbon dioxide and 3% nitrogen.
            <br> 
            Surface: The surface temperature of Venus is extremely high, as much as 475° Celsius (900° Fahrenheit). The pressure at the surface is 92 times that of Earth's at sea level. 
            <br>
            Rotation: Venus spins slowly in the opposite direction from most planets. A day on Venus is 243 Earth days. 
            <br>
            Orbit: Venus orbits the Sun every 224.7 Earth days. </p>
