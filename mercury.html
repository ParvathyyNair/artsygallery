            <br>
            Orbit: Mercury orbits the sun every 88 Earth days, making it the fastest planet in the solar system. 
            <br>
            Temperature: Mercury's surface temperature varies from 400°C during the day to -170°C at night. 
            <br>
            Atmosphere: Mercury has no atmosphere to retain heat. 
            <br>
            Gravity: If you weigh 100 pounds on Earth, you'd weigh 38 pounds on Mercury. 
            <br>
            Name: Mercury is named after the Roman messenger god, who was known for being swift-footed.
